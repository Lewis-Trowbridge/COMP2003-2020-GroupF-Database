## What is this?

This repository contains all of the SQL scripts used to create all of the entities and objects in our database. These scripts have been split up for (relative) brevity by
their type (e.g. tables, views, stored procedures).

## Why store these separately from the applications?

Because both the API and web application use the same database, it would be confusing and overcomplicated to store the SQL scripts in either one of the application repositories.
Therefore, we have come to the decision to store them separately from the applications.

## Product vision
For pub/restaurant businesses, customers 

Who would not have the resources to make their own custom system that fits government guidelines even if they change, to help customers follow guidelines easily 

The CleanTable mobile app and web interface 

Is a table management/booking system, advisory system for venue owners, contact detail storage system for contact tracing 

That takes the burden of keeping up with restrictions off both owners and customers
